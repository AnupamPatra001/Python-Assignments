        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is the a programming paradism which arrange the codes into objects , thats why it is called as object oriented programming.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In OOP class is the blueprint to creating objects .\n",
        "  - It is the bunch of codes and methods which can be used by creating objects.\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In OOP object is the instance of class .\n",
        "  - like a single phone of a phone model.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "  - Abstraction is the process of hiding the unnecessary details , rather than shows only the essential parts.\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is the proscess of bundeling the information by the use of acess modifiers like protected, private and public.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in python are the builts in method that are denoted by double underscore.\n",
        "  - These methods are costumize the object behaviour.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In OOP, inheritance is the concept of accessing or taking the behaviour of the parent class.\n",
        "  - There are many types of inheritance in python.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in OOPs is the concept by which the single method is act like different types depending on the situation .\n",
        "  - In python , polymorphism is done by method overloading and method overriding.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "  - In python, encapsulation is archieved by ;\n",
        "     - By creating class,\n",
        "     - By access modifiers like, publi, protected and private.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "  - The constructor in Python is the special method inside the class which initialize the object.\n",
        "  - It is created by this, __init__.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - In python, class methods are the special methods created by '@classmethod' decorator and used to manage the class level operation.\n",
        "  - While, static methods are created by '@staticmethod' decorator used to access the methods without object creation.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "  - In python method overloading is not default property but it can be achieved by defining same method name with different arguments.\n",
        "  - Generally method overloading is the process of defining many methods with single method name inside the same class.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In OOP, method overriding means defining methods with same name and property but in different class levels like subclass and super class.\n",
        "  - Unlike overloading the method overriding is traditional in python.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "  - It is a type of decorator which allows to use class methods as attribute.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "  - The polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows the same action to work differently depending on the situation.\n",
        "  - It helps in code reusability, clean code.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "  - OOP makes code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain by organizing it into classes and objects.\n",
        "  - It improves flexibility, scalability, and security through inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "  - A class variable is shared by all objects of a class and defined inside the class but outside any method.\n",
        "  - An instance variable is unique to each object and is usually defined inside the __init__ method using self.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python means a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__  methods in Python.\n",
        "  - __str__ defines a human-readable string representation of an object (used by print()), while __repr__ defines a developer-oriented string representation (used in debugging).\n",
        "  - If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to __repr__.\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the super() function in Python ?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class so you can extend or modify inherited behavior without rewriting it.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed .\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod defines a method that does not take self or cls as the first parameter — it can’t access or modify class or instance data, and is just a utility function inside the class.\n",
        "  - @classmethod takes cls as the first parameter — it can access or modify class-level data and works with the class itself rather than a specific object.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "  - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works by letting a child class override a parent class method, and when that method is called on a parent reference, the child's version runs.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is when you call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, because each method returns the object itself (self).\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python lets an object behave like a function, meaning you can \"call\" an instance just like you'd call a normal function.\n",
